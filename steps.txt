(project created with laravel 9.6.0, php 8.1.1, mysql 5.7.31)
-to install the latest version of laravel, make sure your pc(your terminal) is set up to use the php version required by the latest version of laravel(otherwise you will not get the latest version of laravel)
-install laravel using composer, run "composer create-project laravel/laravel my-app"
-the .env config file can't be commited, we can't store credentials in our code(for obvious security reasons). But for the purpose of this app, i'll store all configuration in .env.example, so that when i run the "cp .env.example .env" step from the installation INSTRUCTIONS(from Readme.md), it'll copy all configuration to .env
-there's no fancy laravel command to create a database - so use phpmyadmin or whatever you want to create a database with the configuration found in .env.example (i had to go to https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/?lang=en and update my phpmyadmin for this)
-create the migration files that create the tables, run:
    -php artisan make:migration create_companies_table
    -php artisan make:migration create_employees_table
    (then modify these files to the table structure you want, obviously)
-install Laravel Breeze(https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze): 
    -composer require laravel/breeze --dev
    -php artisan breeze:install














-to run the app navigate to the project folder and run "php artisan serve"

    -"whether you are using raw queries, the query builder, or the Eloquent ORM" - i think the query builder is an alternative to Eloquent, idk
        -https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/database#running-queries - DB facade is another alternative to Eloquent? idk, see about it
-you can use the query builder(i.e. the DB facade), or the Eloquent ORM
